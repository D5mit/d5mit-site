           <h2>Artifacts to enable descriptive to the prescriptive.</h2>
           <p>
               This page is a collection of artifacts created in order to explore the idea of moving from descriptive to a predictive environment.
               It focuses on a socio-technological view on the critical success factors of transforming into a data-driven organisation. The design science research methodology will be followed.

                            The main reason for this implementation, is not to build the fastest
                            and best Agent to play human level Tic Tac Toe, but rather to provide
                            an easy learning experience to anyone new to NN.

                            Classifying if the sentiment was positive or negative.
                            This model was trained on movie review data, but it can be argued that this can
                            be used on any text and classifying if the text is positive or negative.

                            Note this model was built on a Sequential Neural Network using Keras.
                            This approach has some limitations, this approach does not cater for the example:
                            'The movie Terrible, was excellent' vs 'The movie Excellent, was terrible'.
                            ToDo: Investigate a recurrent neural network as an improvement.
