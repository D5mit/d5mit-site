                            A sequential neural network was trained on 25 000 IMDB movie reviews.  Based on the review, the model predicts the movie rating.

                            It can be argued that this model can be used on any text and classifying if the text is positive or negative.
                            <br><br>
                            Note this model was built on a Sequential Neural Network using Keras.
                            This approach has some limitations, this approach does not cater for the example:
                            'The movie Terrible, was excellent' vs 'The movie Excellent, was terrible'.
                            ToDo: Investigate a recurrent neural network as an improvement.
